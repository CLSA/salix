Opal stores variables and values in tables.  Views are used to:
- define a subset of a table, both in terms of variables and values,
- define a subset of many tables in terms of variables and values,
- define derived Variables that are to be resolved against 'real' ones (stored in tables
or other views)
Views are defined in xml or json format and can be save to file for archive or
for transfer between opal instances.

Salix requires the following views, one patient identifier per row:
- baseline: defines baseline dob, sex, ethnicity values (ie. patient attributes that are
  constant over the course of a longitudinal image capture process) required for
  apex_baseline db table.

- meta_*: defines meta data pertaining to dexa images including interview barcode,
  technician, availability, interview site, patient age, height and weight at time of interview
  (* represents the rank of the wave for longitudinal data capture studies).  These values
  are required for apex_exam and apex_scan db tables.

- image_*: links to dexa images in dicom file format, each variable specifies a unique
  image type and laterality (eg. hip_left_image, hip_right_image, spine_image etc.).

Salix also req requires view definitions in json format when such views are updated as
part of ongoing data capture.
