- scans with availability = 0 should not display in apex deployment and code list in UI
- add counts in apex host list: pending, completed, exported
- remove UI Add / create deployment: deployments can only be
  created by the nightly cron script which downloads and validates
  scans by dicom tag content (scans are re-downloaded and sent
  to the deployment host in another scripted procedure)
- correct timezone of scan datetimes: the serial number, which
  represents a physical dexa machine, and hence, a site location
  is known so it is possible to change the default EDT to the
  correct timezone of the site
